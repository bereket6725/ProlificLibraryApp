# ProlificLibraryApp
A library app that draws and posts book data from Prolific Interactive's Server on Heroku.This application is a simple exercise in how one might want use enums as a network abstraction layer to handle  GET, PUT, POST and DELETE requests. While still a trivial application, it strives to take full advantage of the power of swift (protocols, generics and functional methods etc.). 


NOTE: Individual Books can be deleted on our BookListTableViewController by swiping the cell and hitting the delete button
